# Welcome to the HeavyEyelid Project wiki!

This project goal is to provide a Web API to control the libvirt daemon, a virtual machine API written in C.
For this purpose, we are implementting the Boost Beast and Asio libraries to build a asynchronous Web server that transcode JSon queries to the libvirt daemon.

In this wiki, you will find all the functions that we would like to implement, and at terms the complete documentation of our new API.

This project is at the initial state, and we will update this wiki gradually as the progression of the project.
